I can help you get your refund back but as you know I don't charge for my services but after the recovery of your lost funds you can pay me homage.  
First what you have to settle now is the trade lawyer upfront fee which will cost you $200  
Thereafter I'll get the documents for the lawyer to start your recovery and it will take two days to get your money back.

If you're ready there is information I'll need from you to recover your money back, but as it seems now you're not ready because you said "never mind" when you're ready I'll forward you some informations combined with the upfront documents. So it all depends on you now
